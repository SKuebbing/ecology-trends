The field of ecology has experienced rapid growth since the discipline-specific journal, *Ecology*, was first published over a century ago [@reiners2017; @kim2018]. Today, with hundreds of ecology journals representing a multitude of subdisciplines, the field spans in scope from general to applied to theoretical and has become increasingly intertwined with the fields of natural history and conservation. In light of such growth and diversification, accomplishing a broad overview of the field can be challenging.

The discipline of culturomics---the quantitative analysis of large bodies of text or corpa---offers a rich framework with which to track the evolution of a field through time [@michel2011; @ladle2016]. Specifically, word use in the published literature can serve as a proxy for tracking realized, versus perceived, importance. This approach has been applied to subsets of the ecological literature, notably a century of titles and abstracts in the journal *Ecology* [@kim2018], automated content analysis of titles and abstracts in top ecology journals based on impact factor [@mccallen2019], and more specific research questions restricted to certain regions or taxa [e.g., @beale2018].

Here, we build on previous analyses [e.g., @carmel2013; @reiners2017; @kim2018; @mccallen2019] by providing the first full-text analysis of ecology and conservation journals over eight decades encompassing 52 journals, 131,533 articles, and over half a billion words. We base our analysis on the JSTOR full-text corpus of "n-grams" from 1930 to 2010 for all journals that regularly publish ecological or conservation papers and are not regionally or taxonomically exclusive (see Methods). An n-gram is a sequence of terms separated by a space. For example, "biogeography" is a 1-gram and "body size" is a 2-gram (we herein denote n-grams in italics). We standardize n-gram frequency by total words per year and analyze trends over time for a selection of n-grams. We derive our n-gram selection through both algorithmic and hand-curated approaches: (1) drawing on the most frequent and rapidly growing/declining n-grams in various decades and (2) developing logical groupings of terms that fall under key ecology and conservation themes (see Methods). Our approach therefore enables data-derived comparisons of trends in ecology and conservation to yield insights into the evolution of key concepts, analytical techniques, and entire subdisciplines in these fields.

<!-- FIXME: should probably mention that the terms shown in the handpicked panels can represent many underlying related terms. Or do this in the first handpicked figure. -->

# Results

## Broad trends in popularity

We compared trends in the most commonly used terms from the 1940s and the 2000s using 1- and 2-grams (Fig. \@ref(fig:decades)a--d). We found that the most commonly used word (1-gram) in ecology is *species* and that has not changed over the last eighty years with *species* continuing to increase in use (Fig. \@ref(fig:decades)a,c). The next two most commonly terms words in ecology, *plant* and *area*, have also not changed from the 1930s to 2000s. The remaining most commonly used terms from the 1940s have generally declined in use since the 1940s, while all the most commonly used terms in the 2000s have increased in use over time. We saw a similar pattern with popular 2-grams from the 1940s where all such 2-grams are in a state of decline (Fig. \@ref(fig:decades)b), whereas every popular 2-gram in the 2000s has increased in use since the 1930s. By far, the 1- and 2-grams that have had the greatest rise in use over time are *climate* and *climate change* (Fig. \@ref(fig:decades)d--f). This reflects the recognized role humans play in earth's ecosystem processes in the last few decades as concern over climate change has increased alongside the growth of conservation science [@scheffers2016] (Fig. \@ref(fig:decades)e). Other terms also standout because of their conservation implications, such as *conservation*, *impact*, *biodiversity*, *ecosystem service*, *invasive species*, and *global ecology* (Fig. \@ref(fig:decades)e&f), reflecting a general increase in applied ecological research.
<!-- SA: not sure if we need to focus on the fact that the most popular terms now have increased over time, that seems like a truism -->

The changes we observed between popular terms from the 1940s and 2000s likely reflect both a shift in science culture and are reflected in greater societal issues facing Earth. In the 1940s, popular terms such as *time*, *number*, and *day* (Fig. \@ref(fig:decades)a) reference descriptive data, a notable difference compared to terminology use following analytical advancements and when statistics and modelling became standard tools in ecological research. Similar terms that could represent time, day, and number are *data*, *effect*, *population*, and *model* (Fig. \@ref(fig:decades)c), which likely represents both a replacement of terminology and an underlying change in ecology from a semi-quantitative to quantitative discipline. Popular terms in the 1940s included *blue grama* (*Bouteloua gracilis*) and *wheatgrass* (Fig. \@ref(fig:decades)c), which are rarely used today but were of greater significance in the 1940s, likely due to famine in the United States in the 1930s and World War II in the 1940s. For example, blue grama was heavily studied in the 1930s due to its drought tolerance (CITATION), whereas wheat grass research likely intensified in the 1940s to feed troops fighting in World War II (CITATION). This focus on agricultural research was supported by other popular 2-grams from the 1940s, such as *organic matter*, *soil moisture*, and *fresh water* (Fig. \@ref(fig:decades)c).

We used a fill-in-the-blank strategy to algorithmically examine the dominant 2-grams associated with levels of scale in ecology (Fig. \@ref(fig:blanks)). We found that *species richness* and *plant species* have been the dominant adjective and noun uses of the term *species*, respectively (Fig. \@ref(fig:blanks)ab). The term *native* rose in popularity around 2000 to become the third most common term preceding *species* as of 2010 (Fig. \@ref(fig:blanks)b). As an adjective, the term *population* has been primarily associated with *size*, *growth*, *dynamics*, and *density*, with *population growth* following approximately exponential growth itself (Fig. \@ref(fig:blanks)d). Conversely, *natural population* was the dominant noun-form of *population*, but was surpassed by *human population* as of 2010 (Fig. \@ref(fig:blanks)e). Ecologists have written about *community structure*, and *community composition* more than any other adjective-form of *community* and about *plant communities*, within our corpus, over three times more often (FIXME: check) than any other form of community (Fig. \@ref(fig:blanks)gh). Ecologists first used the term *ecosystem* as a noun long before using it as an adjective starting around 1990 (Fig. \@ref(fig:blanks)jk). As a noun, *ecosystem* has been most commonly associated with *forest*, *terrestrial*, and *marine*, with the latter seeing a sharp uptick since 2000 (Fig. \@ref(fig:blanks)k). As an adjective, *ecosystem service* and *ecosystem function* are by far the dominant 2-grams (Fig. \@ref(fig:blanks)j).

Using the same approach, we examined adjectives associated with conservation, diversity, experiment, and analysis (Fig. \@ref(fig:blanks)). *Biodiversity conservation* did not appear until the mid 1980s in our corpus but is now used over twice as often as the next most common conservation term, *nature conservation* (Fig. \@ref(fig:blanks)c). *Genetic diversity* has skyrocketed since the early 1990s to become the dominant adjective associated with diversity (Fig. \@ref(fig:blanks)f). *Field* and *laboratory experiment* peaked around 1990 and have been declining since (Fig. \@ref(fig:blanks)i). *Statistical*, the first adjective associated with *analysis* that made the top eight terms, continued to see growth as of 2010 (Fig. \@ref(fig:blanks)l); however, *data analysis*, which didn't appear until 1950, surpassed statistical analysis around 2000 (Fig. \@ref(fig:blanks)l). *Meta-analysis*, which first appeared in the late 1980s in our corpus, has seen rapid growth to become the most common adjective associated with analysis as of 2010 (Fig. \@ref(fig:blanks)l).

## Community ecology

From the onset, ecologists and conservation biologists have studied organisms at the species-level, reflected by the sustained growth of *species* in the corpus over time (Fig. \@ref(fig:ecology)a). Though references to *cell*ular level were initially the next-most common, interest within the field of ecology has since transition to *populations*, followed by *communities* and *ecosystems* (Fig. \@ref(fig:ecology)b). *Competition* and *predation* are the interactions most commonly included in the corpus, yet both interactions are experiencing sharp relative declines since the 1980's and early 2000's, respectively (Fig. \@ref(fig:ecology)c).  Interestingly, the most commonly represented theories in ecology all appear to be in declining use (Fig. \@ref(fig:ecology)d). For example, the theory of the *climax community* climaxed in the 1940s, followed by the peak for the *theory of island* biogeography in the late 1970's, early 1980's, and a peak and dropoff in *neutral theory* in the mid-2000's as each was posed to help explain community structure and diversity patterns (REF) (Fig. \@ref(fig:ecology)d). Though we do not observe correlations between the rise and fall of the most common theories and the most common hypotheses, the decline in the mention of *competition* (Fig. \@ref(fig:ecology)c)is mirrored by the decline in interest in the competition hypothesis (Fig. \@ref(fig:ecology)e), which as terms in the corpus may be inextricably intertwined in this context.  Overall, while metrics of *abundance* were initially the most commonly reported (Fig. \@ref(fig:ecology)c). they plateaued in the 2000s while references to *diversity*, which incorporates both *abundance* and *richness*, have become the most common since the mid 1990s (Fig. \@ref(fig:ecology)c).

## Statistics and data analysis

Ecology has increasingly become a data- and model-centric discipline in recent decades (Fig. \@ref(fig:decades)). *Regression*, an overarching term encompassing many statistical approaches, saw continued and rapid growth in use since the 1950s, approaching *correlation* by 2005 (Fig. \@ref(fig:methods)a). References to *ANOVA* and *t-tests* both peaked around 2000, while mentions of generalized linear models (*GLMs*) steadily increased in frequency surpassing *t-tests* around 2007(?) (Fig. \@ref(fig:methods)a). In terms of how such models were fit, *least-squares*, formerly the dominant paradigm, was rapidly surpassed by *Bayesian*, *maximum likelihood*, and *information theoretic* terms around 2000; as of 2010, the term *Bayesian* was used over twice as often as *maximum likelihood* (Fig. \@ref(fig:methods)b). The Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling method (*MCMC*), which combined with modern computing power has been responsible for the boom in applied Bayesian data analysis [@gelman2014b] first appears in the corpus in 1994 [@thompson1994], 24 years after Hastings[@hastings1970] described the concept. Such statistical approaches and paradigms have been associated with endless debates about the role of hypothesis testing in ecology (REFs). To that end, use of the phrase *null hypothesis* peaked in the 1980s and the phrase *significant difference* peaked around 1990 and has declined since (Fig. \@ref(fig:methods)c). The associated terms *p-value* and *confidence interval* appeared in approximately equal frequency as of 2010 (Fig. \@ref(fig:methods)c), although both are often referred to by abbreviations missed in our corpus (e.g. 'p =' or 'CI'). *Power analysis* remains a rarely used term despite numerous pleas of its importance [@nakagawa2007; @smith2011d]. The increased frequency of so many data- and model-centric terms, along with the advent of online publishing, has coincided with the meteoric rise of *supplementary material* n-grams since around 2000---the 2-gram itself had the second most rapid increase across all 2-grams from 2000--2010 (Fig. \@ref(fig:decades)f)---and a decline in *unpublished data* (Fig. \@ref(fig:methods)d).

## Genetics

The focus on genetics in ecology and conversation related research has skyrocketed in the past several decades. This can be seen in the increase in the use of the term *genetic diversity* (Fig. \@ref(fig:blanks)f and \@ref(fig:methods)e). *Phylogenetics* remained the most commonly referenced genetic term from 1930 to 2010, and increased in use rapidly since the 1990s (Fig. \@ref(fig:methods)e). With the advent of *next-generation sequencing* (ADD REF?), we also see an increase in sequencing-based approaches to studying genetic diversity, particularly the rise in references to *single nucleotide polymorphisms* (Fig. \@ref(fig:methods)f). Notably, the term *epigenetics* has been in use since the 1950s (Supplementary Fig. \@ref(fig:methods-all)), before ecologists even had methods for studying epigenetics in the modern sense [@bird2007]. This is likely because, beginning in the 1940s, *epigenetics* was used to refer to the differentiation of cells during embryonic development [@waddington2012].

## Conservation and applied ecology

*Conservation* and themes related to applied ecology represented some of the fastest growing themes in modern ecology (Fig. \@ref(fig:decades)e). Conservation as a field originated alongside the formation of the Society for Conservation Biology in 1985 [@meine2006], prior to which the roughly synonymous term *preservation* was used as frequently in ecological literature (Fig. \@ref(fig:cons)a). *Biodiversity*, a core concept of conservation, replaced the terminology *biological diversity* that had been in use since the 1960s [@soule1980]. Alongside *conservation*, *biodiversity* is one of the most rapidly growing terms we analyzed in the corpus (Fig. 1e). Given the prominent focus on biodiversity conservation in the field of ecology, ecologists have increasingly studied the major threats to biodiversity loss: *habitat loss*, *invasive species*, *pollution*, *overpopulation*, *overexploitation*, and *climate change* (Fig. \@ref(fig:cons)b). Despite *overexploitation* being considered the most prevalent threat of species extinctions worldwide [@maxwell2016], the concept has received the least attention from ecologists both historically and currently (Fig. \@ref(fig:cons)b). Up until the early 1990s, *pollution* was the leading concept in the context of threats to biodiversity --- its use in the ecological literature having peaked in the mid 1970s (Fig. \@ref(fig:cons)b). Interestingly, frequencies of the concept *ozone*, typically associated with studies of pollution, showed similar responses as *pollution*, but with a lag of approximately 15 years (Fig. \@ref(fig:cons)c). *Pollution* was then surpassed by *climate change* and subsequently by *invasive species*, two threats that now vastly outweigh all other threats in terms of their frequency of usage (Fig. \@ref(fig:cons)b) and two of the top three fastest growing terms in all of ecology (Fig. 1f).

A multitude of concepts originated alongside the proliferation of studies of climate change, habitat loss, and overexploitation (Fig. \@ref(fig:cons)c-e). With such relatively recent concept formations, most of these concepts are experiencing continued growth. For example, concepts related to climate change, such as *ocean acidification*, *range shifts*, and *climate extremes* have shown sharp upticks since the mid 2000s (Fig. \@ref(fig:cons)c). Other concepts have shown more complex patterns. For example, *sea-level rise* showed a large spike in usage in the mid 1990s, a dramatic downturn in usage by 2000, and then another sharp increase thereafter (Fig. \@ref(fig:cons)c). *Fragmentation* rose sharply following the common usage of the related term *habitat loss* around 1990, but its use has been in decline since about 2000 (Fig. \@ref(fig:cons)d). In terms of modes of overexploitation, which include both methods of species exploitation and resource extraction, *fishing* is currently the leading concept, followed by *hunting* and *logging* (Fig. \@ref(fig:cons)e). Historically, *hunting* and *fishing* have exchanged positions of dominance in the ecological literature roughly every decade, showing predator-prey-like dynamics in their frequency distributions over time (Fig. \@ref(fig:cons)e). Modes of exploitation of non-animal resources, such as *logging*, *harvesting*, and *mining* have consistently been discussed less in the ecological literature compared to modes of animal exploitation (Fig. \@ref(fig:cons)e).

The prevention of biodiversity loss is a key goal of conservation ecologists, and the concept of protection has long been a pillar of biodiversity conservation [@watson2014]. Until roughly 2000, *park* was the most frequently used term related to forms of geographic protection (Fig. \@ref(fig:cons)f). *Protected areas* has grown steadily over the past eight decades with the growth in *marine protected areas* showing a similar pattern, but lagging by several decades (Fig. \@ref(fig:cons)f). These patterns of usage approximately mirror the growth rate of actual protected land and sea area globally [@watson2014]. Many of the key forms of geographic protection, including *parks*, *reserves*, *protected areas*, and *preserves* predated the common usage of the term *conservation* (Fig. \@ref(fig:cons)a,f), although this could be due in part to several of these also acting as verbs. Nevertheless, the clear and sustained rise in all terms related to geographic protection over eight decades points to their continued importance in conservation and applied ecology.

## Social sciences and ecology

<!-- FIXME: Figure out a way to make this paragraph match the style of the other paragraphs a bit better (in particular, make sure some of the terms are referred to in italics) -->
Over the last few decades, there has been increasing attention to human dimensions in ecology and biodiversity conservation. Since the 1990s, there has been an exponential increase in research on market or community-based conservation interventions (Fig. \@ref(fig:social)a)---particularly environmental certification programs and payment for ecosystem services schemes such as the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD) program. We also observed an increased focus on human wellbeing (Fig. \@ref(fig:social)b), with a spike of research on human health in the 1970s and, more recently, an overall growth in research on poverty, food security, and overall human wellbeing since the 1990--2000s. Given the increased focus on the human dimensions of biodiversity conservation over the last decades [@bennett2017], it was expected that social science methods such as interviews and questionnaires would become more widely used in the literature (Fig. \@ref(fig:social)c). However, more qualitative methods such as focus groups, ethnography, or participant observation remain scarcely used, which supports the assertion that ecology and conservation continue to rely mostly on quantitative methods (REF?). Parallel to the increased focus on human wellbeing since the 1970s was the increased research on various stakeholders and local communities (Fig. \@ref(fig:social)d). Yet, it is
clear that key stakeholder groups such as indigenous people are still greatly
underrepresented if we take into account how much land is under indigenous
management [@garnett2018].
<!-- FIXME: I like the last sentence but I wonder if it's sticking our neck a bit out beyond our specific results to include it in this paper... maybe modify it slightly? -->

# Discussion

1. Quick recap and importance of work

Possibly any overall crosscutting themes

<!-- Generally a movement from sharing ecology with biology to becoming its own discipline -->

<!-- things on their way out on way out, e.g. natural history, is that the way we want to go the way the field is moving, e.g., meta-analysis -->

2. comparisons to related work; what's similar and what's different?

3. caveats

- word use doesn't necessarily mean important
- may not represent true trends and concepts and importance to fields
- some journal titles are sold next in with the terms
- the corpus doesn't represent all or even necessarily a random selection of ecology journals
- important journals like Science and Nature are missing
- there is a mixing of biology and ecology especially in the earlier years
- OCR problems especially on older texts
- but can mention some similar trends compared to other studies with very different approaches
- but this really is the best we can do; first full text analysis across multiple journals for the field
- as to a growing body of knowledge through multiple lines of inference

<!-- TODO: make sure we include some citations from nat ecol evol -->

## Data

We worked with the JSTOR data team to extract n-gram data from the fulltext of their database for a set of journals relevant to ecology and conservation. To select a set of journals, we reviewed all journals from the "Ecology & Evolutionary Biology" and "Biological Sciences" subject groups to evaluate their suitability for the analysis. We eliminated journals from our corpus according to the following rules: (1) We removed all journals that were taxonomically specific (e.g., we did not retain "Annals of Botany") to reduce any taxonomic bias through time. This step reduced the corpus from just over 1 billion words to just over 0.5 billion words, although the patterns in the 'curated panels' (Fig. \@ref(fig:ecology)--\@ref(fig:social) remained largely unchanged. (2) We removed all journals that were not in English. We removed all journals that were not focussed on ecology or conservation (e.g., we removed journals that were purely biology focused). (3) We removed journals that appeared in the JSTOR database for less than TODO years unless they were still in the database as of 2010 or continued under a different name. (4) We removed journals that were region specific. Specifically, be removed journals that were longitude specific but retained journals that were latitude specific (e.g., we retained "Arctic and Alpine Research" but not "Great Basin Naturalist Memoirs"). In total, our corpus included `r n_journals` journals (Table \@ref(tab:included-journals), Fig. \@ref(fig:totals-by-journal)). We focused on 1-, 2-, and 3-grams since most common terms we were interested in were three words or less and the computational burden increased with longer n-grams. 

```{r}
# Removed PNAS IDs:
pnas_excluded_pub_ids <-
  readRDS(here::here("data/generated/pnas_exluded_pub_ids.rds"))
```

Our initial analyses revealed a number of necessary data-cleaning steps prior to our final analysis. (1) Our initial corpus was dominated by data from Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), which also publishes a high volume of papers not relevant to ecology or conservation. Therefore, we excluded all papers (`r length(pnas_excluded_pub_ids)`) from PNAS that did not include one of the 1-grams "ecology" or "ecological". (2) We removed a series of TeX terms that were inadvertently included from the American Naturalist (e.g., "amsmath" and "documentclass"). (3) We limited our analysis to 1930--2010. Before 1930, there was a considerably more limited set of journals included in the corpus, and after 2010, the the JSTOR corpus the number of journals present and the total number of words began to decline  as more recent volumes were not yet included in the dataset (Fig. \@ref(fig:total-by-year)). These issues led to presumably spurious trends before 1930 or after 2010.

```{r}
bad_amnat <- readr::read_lines(here::here("data/bad-amnat.txt")) # latex code
bad_amnat <- tolower(sort(bad_amnat))
bad_amnat <- paste(bad_amnat, collapse = ", ")
```

## Algorithmic panels

We conducted a series of data processing steps to determine the most popular 1- and 2-grams in the 1940s and 2000s. To speed computation, we began by filtering the full data set down to the top 5000 1- and 2-grams over the entire time span. We then removed all n-grams that included numbers, we removed all 1-grams that had 3 or fewer characters, and we removed 2-grams in which either the first or second had 3 or fewer characters. To focus only on relevant parts of speech, we assigned parts of speech with the R function `koRpus::treetag()`. For 1-grams, we retained only nouns. For 2-grams, we retained only adjectives and nouns. Using the same parsing from `koRpus::treetag()`, we aggregated all remaining n-grams by their lemmas. For example, "plant" and "plants" are both derived from the same lemma "plant" and were combined. At this stage, we retained the top 500 1- and 2-gram lemmas by the frequency over the entire time span. We then excluded a set of n-grams that would primarily be used as affiliations or journal names or were frequent figures of speech unrelated to ecology (Table \@ref(tab:exclusion-n-grams)). After these filtering steps, we retained the top 9 1- and 2-grams in the time periods 1940--1950 and 2000--2010 for plotting.

Using the filtered dataset as described above with the top 500 1- and 2-grams, we determined the n-grams with the most rapid increases and decreases by fitting generalized linear models. We fit models of the form: $y_i \sim \mathrm{QuasiPoisson}(\mu_i),\ $ $\log(\mu_i) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \mathrm{year_i} + \log(\mathrm{total}_i)$, where $y_i$ refers to the number of occurrences of a given n-gram in year $i$, $\mu_i$ refers to the expected number of occurrences, the $\beta$ terms refer to estimated parameters, 'year' refers to a respective year, and '$\mathrm{total}_i$', which acts as an offset term, refers to the total number of 1-grams in year $i$. We sorted the n-grams by their $\beta_1$ coefficient values in the above model to determine the 9 1- and 2-grams with the most rapid increases and decreases from 1930--1960 and 1980--2010.

## Curated panels

In addition to the algorithmic analysis described above, we assembled "curated" panels in which we used our knowledge of the field to explore groups of related terms in the corpus (Fig. \@ref(fig:ecology)--\@ref(fig:social)). We developed these term groups through brainstorming sessions and iterative consultation with other postdoctoral fellows and alumni of the David H. Smith Conservation Research Fellowship Program. In many cases, we combined multiple related n-grams under a single umbrella term in the figures. For example, *GLM* and *generalized linear model* (and their plural forms) all appear as *GLM* in Fig. \@ref(fig:methods) and *human health*, *child health*, *childrens health*, *human health*, and *womens health* all appear as *human health* in Fig. \@ref(fig:social).

The top n-grams are defined based on summing the occurrences throughout the entire time period thereby weighting recent years more heavily.

(ref:fig-ecology-cap) **Community ecology n-grams from 1930--2010.** Curated sets of n-grams related to themes in community ecology. Light grey lines indicate frequency of the n-gram per 100,000 words. Dark coloured trend lines and associated shaded ribbons represent generalized additive model (GAM) fits and 95% confidence intervals (see Supporting Material).

(ref:fig-blanks-supp-cap) Additional fill-in-the-blank figure panels using the same approach as Fig. \@ref(fig:blanks). Each panel shows the top eight 2-gram terms where the *blank* in the panel label is filled in by the noun or adjective indicated beside each trend. For example, in panel **a**, "Theory of *blank*" with the term "evolution" corresponds to "Theory of evolution".
